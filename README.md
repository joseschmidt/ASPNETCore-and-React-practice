# ASPNETCore and React practice 
A practice with the new open source framework by microsoft ASP .Net Core Web Application and front end with React.js

With this repo I want to make a functional and good webapp, and understand how implement ASP.NET Core web applications, and also get some experience with react.

Some of those goals are listed bellow:

Step 1
- [X] Develop one basic Web API to be consumed by front end as an example
- [X] React is on the project and working
- [X] Consume that basic web API in the front end with react

Step 2
- [X] Implement Unity Tests for the CRUD services, to use TDD practice
- [ ] Implement IMDB (in memory database) with the Entity framework
- [ ] Develop a REST Api and make a CRUD example consuming with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

Step 3
- [ ] Develop the Unity Tests for the react CRUD _things_ (idk the name yet)
- [ ] Develop the screens to make that CRUD works using React and some HTML and CSS things

Step 4
- [ ] Be proud
